## Introduction

In this project, a stream of simulated mixed LIDAR and RADAR data will be used to estimate the trajectory of an object moving in a curved trajectory by using the unscented Kalman filter for both data sets. The theory and formulas used in this project can be found [here](../KalmanFIlter.pdf). The measurement noises for the LIDAR data are $\sigma_x$ = $\sigma_y$ = 0.15 m. The measurement noises for the RADAR data are $\sigma_r$ = 0.30 m, $\sigma_\phi$ = 0.03 rad and $\sigma_\dot{r}$ = 0.3 m/s.
